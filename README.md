# THIS IS A FORK

This fork supports multiple files export. The rest is the same.

## Exporting Multiple Files

When you select more than 1 files, you will see two buttons for downloading multiple files, one for each of the side.

Clicking on either of them download your images with settings of that side.

# [Squoosh]!

- [Basic visitor data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?ref_topic=2919631).
- The before and after image size value.
